I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University 🐿️](https://www.rupp.edu.kh/), driven by a *sincere passion* for **Software Engineering 💻.**

I am a flexible and adaptable professional with a passion for leadership,
teamwork, and collaboration. With strong communication and
organizational skills, I excel in dynamic environments and enjoy exploring
new technologies. My goal is to use my expertise to drive innovation,
support meaningful projects, and contribute to economic growth while
building strong team relationships.

In my spare time, I focus on contributing to open-source projects, alongside working out 💪🏻, capturing street photography 📸, and writing tech content ✍🏻.

**Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding 👨🏻‍💻**
